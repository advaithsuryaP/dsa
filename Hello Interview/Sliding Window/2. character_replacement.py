Problem: 

Write a function to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter in a given string s, 
after performing at most k operations in which you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English letter.

Example:
s = "BBABCCDD"
k = 2

Output: 5
Explanation: Replace the first 'A' and 'C' with 'B' to form "BBBBBCDD". The longest substring with identical letters is "BBBBB", which has a length of 5.

def character_replacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    return

print(character_replacement("BBABCCDD", 2)) # 5
