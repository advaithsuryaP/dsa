Problem:
Write a function to calculate the maximum number of fruits you can collect from an integer array fruits, where each element represents a type of fruit. 
You can start collecting fruits from any position in the array, but you must stop once you encounter a third distinct type of fruit.
The goal is to find the longest subarray where at most two different types of fruits are collected.
