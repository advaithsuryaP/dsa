Problem Statement:
    Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.
    A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. 
    It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "racecar"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "hello"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: true

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Solution 1
        # normalized: list[str] = []
        # for ch in s:
        #     if(ch.isalnum()):
        #         normalized.append(ch.lower())
        # return normalized == normalized[::-1]

        # Solution 2
        normalized = [ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum()]
        return normalized == normalized[::-1]

print(solution.isPalindrome("racecar")) # true
print(solution.isPalindrome("hello")) # false
print(solution.isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")) # true
print(solution.isPalindrome("Was it a car or a cat I saw?")) # true

üß© Problem Restatement:
Given a string `s`, return True if it is a palindrome ‚Äî i.e., it reads the same 
forward and backward ‚Äî ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

Examples:
    "racecar" ‚Üí True
    "hello" ‚Üí False
    "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" ‚Üí True
    "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" ‚Üí True

---

ü™ú Naive Approach:
Reverse the string directly and compare ‚Üí `s == s[::-1]`.
However, that fails when there are spaces, punctuation, or case differences.

---

üí° Key Insight:
We only care about **letters and digits**, and the check must be **case-insensitive**.
So before comparing, we normalize the input:
1. Convert all characters to lowercase.
2. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters.
After normalization, a direct equality check with the reversed version suffices.

---

‚öôÔ∏è Optimized Approach (O(n) time, O(n) space):
- Build a filtered list of lowercase alphanumeric characters using list comprehension.
- Compare it with its reverse using slicing.

    normalized = [ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum()]
    return normalized == normalized[::-1]

This leverages Python‚Äôs slicing and comprehension for both readability and efficiency.

---

üß† Intuition Recap:
A palindrome check boils down to symmetry.
By cleaning and lowercasing upfront, we ensure that both sides of the symmetry are comparable.
Slicing (`[::-1]`) in Python gives a reversed copy, making the comparison one clean step.

---

‚è± Complexity Analysis:
- Time:  O(n) ‚Üí One pass for filtering, one for reversing, one for comparing.
- Space: O(n) ‚Üí Because we store the normalized list.

---

‚úÖ Example walkthrough:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Step 1 ‚Üí normalized = ['a','m','a','n','a','p','l','a','n','a','c','a','n','a','l','p','a','n','a','m','a']
Step 2 ‚Üí normalized[::-1] is identical.
Result ‚Üí True
