Problem Statement: Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings into a single string and decode the string back to the original list of strings.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["lint","code","love","you"]
Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]

üß© Problem: Encode and Decode Strings
------------------------------------
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings into a single string and 
decode it back without any loss of information.

Example:
---------
Input:  ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]
Encode: "4#lint4#code4#love3#you"
Decode: ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]

---

Naive Approach:
---------------
Use a simple delimiter like "," to join and split.
    encoded = ",".join(strs)
    decoded = encoded.split(",")
‚ùå Problem: What if the strings themselves contain commas (",")?
Decoding breaks because we can't tell delimiter vs data apart.

---

Key Insight:
-------------
We need a *self-describing format*.
If each string says how long it is, we can always decode safely ‚Äî
no matter what characters the string contains.

So, encode each word as:
    "<len>#<word>"
Example: "4#love"

Then just concatenate all such chunks.

---

Optimized Approach:
-------------------
Encoding:
    - For each word, compute len(word)
    - Add "len#word" to the output string
    - O(N) time and space, where N is total number of characters

Decoding:
    - Parse characters left to right.
    - Read up to the next '#', which gives us the length of the next word.
    - Use that length to extract exactly that many characters after '#'.
    - Continue until string is fully consumed.

Example:
---------
Encoded = "4#love3#you"
Iteration:
    - Read "4#", ‚Üí length = 4
    - Extract next 4 chars ‚Üí "love"
    - Move pointer to next chunk ‚Üí "3#you"
    - Repeat ‚Üí "you"
Output = ["love", "you"]

---

Complexity:
------------
Time  = O(N)  (both encode and decode scan each character once)
Space = O(N)  (output string and list store all data once)

---

üí° Summary:
This problem is a perfect example of *data self-description* ‚Äî
when a string needs to encode its own structure so it can be losslessly parsed.
It‚Äôs simple, elegant, and interview gold because it tests your
understanding of edge cases, not just syntax.
